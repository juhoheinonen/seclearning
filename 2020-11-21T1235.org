* Secure software concepts 10: Defense in depth

- Layered defense
- Ensuring that a system is subject to no signle point of compromise

1) Defend the local enclave
2) Defend the enclave perimeter
3) Defend networks and communications
4) Defend the infrastructure

** Application infrastructure

-> Do not rely on *network security* to defend an application.
-> Defend the device (the application is running on).
   E.g. if application is secure but device is compromised it's bad.
-> Use secure APIs.
-> Deploy on secure infrastructure/architecture.
   E.g. isolate web application from sensitive data not needed by it.
-> Database security.
   Application is often frontend that allows access to database.

** Network security

-> Encryption. Networks are target to monitoring.
-> Firewalls. Firewalls on perimeter but also inside company network.
-> IDS/IPS. Intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system.
-> Network segmentation. Security zones. E.g. server rooms.

** Application defense

-> Protect:
   - Input.
   - Processing.
   - Error handling.
   - Output.
   - Display. Screen filter (person next to me cannot see what's on display).
   - Storage.

*** Input validation

-> Range of value.
-> Format of input.
-> *Repeat at browser and server side.*
-> Numeric.
-> Completeness. That all required fields have been filled, and all credit card number digits are inputted.
-> Error handling.


** Key points

- Layered defense is a critical part of the design of a system.
  -> We have to seek out single points of failure and avoid them.
  -> Defend at each point.
