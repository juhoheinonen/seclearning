* Secure software design 44: Asymmetric algorithms (public key)

Operates using a pair of keys
- One half of the key pair is the private key and must be kept secret by the owner of the key pair
- The other half of the key pair is the public key and it can be shared with anyone

The keys are mathematically related and must always be used as a pair.

** Benefits

Can be used to distribute symmetric keys confidentially. Asymmetric algorithms are very slow.
- IPSec (Diffie-Hellman)
- TLS (RSA)

Can authenticate each party to the transaction
- Certificates

Used in digital signatures
