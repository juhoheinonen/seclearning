* Secure software design 33: Performing architectural risk assessment

As the system is being designed, risk that was not visible at a high level before may be noticed.

Attention should be given to emerging threats associated with the architectural model selected.

** External risk areas to consider

Some of the external risk areas to consider:
- the operational environment
- the user community
  -> Impact on business operations
  -> Training requirements
- Integration with legacy systems
- Legal and regulatory constraints
  -> Location of data and processing

** Internal risk areas to consider

Some of the internal risk areas to consider:
- Single points of failure
- Attack surface
- Complexity

** Review risk associated with chosen solution
- Centralized systems
- Distributed computing
- Networking
  -> Wireless Networking
- Storage
- Disaster recovery

The security requirements traceability matrix should be reviewed to ensure that all
identified threats and requirements have been met.

"The software architect should review the proposed design of the system to ensure
that all risks have been identified and handled appropriately."
