** .NET

Executes in a software envrionment (as compared to a hardware-based environment)

CLR
- an application virtual machine
- Provides services such as: security, memory management, exception handling

CLR supplies managed code with services such as cross-language interaction, code access security, 
object lifetime management and debugging and profile support.

The risk associated with CLR settings is the ability to access external system resources, 
call unmanaged code and acquire system privileges.
