* Secure software Concepts 1

** project failure reasons:
- Late delivery
- Overbudget
- Fails to meet user expectations

** good idea:
- Integrate security early on


Define -> Design -> Develop -> Deploy
       	  	    	       |< Security comes first only here!


** What is security?
- for security professional
-- protection
-- safety
-- confidentiality, integrity, availability
-- trust

"security is everyone's business"

"create interest and explain!"
"show progress"

- security is based on the culture of the organization

- "make security simple"

" security is about the survival of the organization
-- protection of jobs
-- compliance with laws
-- customer trust and satisfaction

"Application security is importent"
- primary attack surface
- controls access to data and data sources
- reliable operations is essential for attainment of business mission

** Core concepts

"CIA triad"

*** Confidentiality
- protection of sensitive data
-- if data to wrong hands it would cause harm to individual or organization

--Personally identifiable information (PII)
--- information that could be used to identify an individual or their location
-- Protected health information (PHI)
-- Payment Card Data (PCI-DSS)

-- Unauthorized disclosure
--- Poor data display/unmasked fields on screen
--- employess sharing data with co-workers/outsiders
--- Sensitive data on reports - credit card receipts with entire credit card data


--- masking/obfuscation
--- view based access controls
--- encryption

"A core requirement of security is to protect sensitive data from improper disclosure."
-> "Legal and contractual requirement"

*** Integrity

- Protection of sensitive data
- Protection of integrity of systems processing
--> ATM shows correct amount of money and transfers correct amount of money
- Protection from improper modification or alteration
-- Accidental (noise)
-- Intentional (fraud)

- assure data is same before sending through network
- field truncation
- incorrect rounding/calculations
-- "salami attack" -> shave little bits of money off a transaction


- Digital signature
-- Prove the integrity and authentication of the message
--- who did the message come from?
-- Proof of sender (non-repudiation)
-- Proof that the message was not altered in transit

- Protection of software code
-- code signing
-- Proof that software is:
--- from a trusted source
--- has not been modified
-- prevents infection (trojan horse) of software

- Reliability
-- Trust in the integrity of data
--- Accuracy of financial reports (SoX)

"A core requirement of security is to protect sensitive data from unauthorized modification."

"Compliance and security of data processing."

*** Availability

- Ensuring systems and data reliably support mission/business needs
- Determine business availability requirements
- Is often referred to as criticality

- Single points of failure
-- The mission requires information to be accessible in a timely manner
--- Prevent system failure
--- Prevent data loss
-- Idenfity single points of failure
--- where failure in single thing can cause system level failure

- Failover
-- Providing redundant facilities or capabilities so that the failure of a single component will not interrupt service
-- Failover should be an automatic process that will cause the system to fail over to the secondary or alternate component in the event of failure of the primary component

- Replication and clustering
-- Duplication of equipment/networks/processing capability
-- May be used in *load sharing * or as a failover
-- Some systems will require a manual cutover to the alternate system
--- this means that failover may need to be manually turned on I think

- Scalability
-- The ability to adjust equipment to meet capacity requirements
-- One of the main advantages of the cloud
--- Self-service, on demand capacity
-- Allows rapid adjustment to increase or decrease capacity

- Resiliency
-- Robustness - ability to withstand attack or equipment failure
-- Ability of a system to operate in adverse conditions
--- Perhaps at a degraded level of performance

"A core requirement of security is to ensure the availability of systems and information to meet mission requirements."
"Availability is the prevention of destruction of data or systems and the ability to maintain operational capability."
