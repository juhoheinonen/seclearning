* Secure software concepts 6: Credential management

** Credential management systems

*** Secure issuance and management of smart cards and smart USB tokens
*** Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates
*** One-time passwords (OTPs)
- Can't be subject to reply attack.
*** Biometrics

** Credential management
- May support a diverse and dispersed user population.
  --- Support centralized access control.
- Can be managed remotely.
- Credentials may be re-issued when necessary.

** Credential-based Authentication
- May be offered internally or by a third party acting as a Credential Service Provider (CSP).
- Provides Authentication services to websites of several organizations.
- Usually based on hardware tokens or smartcards.

** Credential management considerations
- Credentials are some of the most desirable targets for attackers.
- Insecure credential issuance leads to increased risk.
- Policies and practices must be developed to support credential management.

** Credential management system risk
- Attackers that compromise a credential management system can gain undetected privileged access to systems.
- Re-issuing credentials can be expensive and time-consuming.
  -> Especially if you have to send new tokens or smart cards.
- Performance may be impacted by delays in processing credentials.
  -> Network connectivity issues to central management etc.
- Poor use of credentials (e.g. poor protection) may compromise the system.

** Key points
- Ensuring that all users have the correct levels of access can be done through credentials, PKI, and certificates.
- This provides the correct levels of entitlement and permissions to protect sensitive data and systems.
