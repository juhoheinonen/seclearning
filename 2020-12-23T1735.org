* Secure software design 29: Upstream and downstream dependencies

** Interfaces

May occur at many levels
- Network
- Utilities
- Middleware
- Sub-processes
- Users

** Upstream liabilities (we receive input)

Invalid input

Duplicated data

Incomplete data

** Solutions

Input validation
- Allowable values
- Range of values
- Completeness of input

Integrity
- Hash totals
- Sequence numbers

Confidentiality
- Encryption
- Anonymization

Secure access control
- Remote access

** Downstream liability (we input something)

Infecting other systems
- Designed intentional data sharing
- Unauthorized data sharing
  -> Digital rights management (DRM)

** Interface connectivity

Bluetooth

RFID

Near-field communications (NFC)

802.11

** Interface communications risks

Loss of connectivity

Unauthorized access

Accuracy of data - noise

Jamming

** Managing a network channel

Procedures for approval for establishing the connection

Process to monitor channel and report on any problems

Defined process for disconnecting
- *Do not leave half open connection*

** Encryption

Provides benefits of:
- Access control
- Authentication
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Proof of origin (non-repudiation)
