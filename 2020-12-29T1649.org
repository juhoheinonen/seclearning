* Secure software design 39: Evaluate and select resuable secure design

Many security solutions are already available for use by the systems and security architects
- proven technology, prevent introducing new errors
- more supportive of audit

** Concepts of system security

Build security into every component of the system
- Operating systems
- Utilities and drivers. From reputable sources.
- Networks.
- Databases.
- Middleware.
- Applications.
- End-points and interfaces.

* Secure software design 40: Operating system security

Isolation between security kernel and other less important functions.
- Ring protection model. Usually 4 rings.

Patching.

Choice of operating system
- Reliability
- Open source or proprietary

Utilities
- Restrictions on access to privileged utilities
- Patching
- Use of *trusted products*
  -> Fake drivers, utilities and processes
  -> Signed code

Network security
- Architectural design:
  -> Isolation
     VLANs
     DMZ
     Extranet

Layered network defense
- Avoid single points of failure or compromise
  -> Proxies
  -> Firewalls
     Different types
  -> IDS/IPS
  -> Redundancy
