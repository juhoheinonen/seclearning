     - *not understanding the business problems that need to be solved*. Often people design the new system based on existing business process even though changes would be needed.
     - Lack of understanding technology.

  -> must be based on both current and future needs. Business is evolving, and we must build systems that are flexible enough to change when needed.
  -> Must consider how the system will fit into its operational environment. Problem: we build an excellent system but it's independent. Today we have to design enterprise-wide solution that integrates seamlessly
