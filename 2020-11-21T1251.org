* Secure software concepts 11: Fail safe

- The ability of a system to fail in a way which does not compromise security and protects the assets of the organization.

- Systems must be able to fail and still maintain the safety of personnel

--> Manual and automatic overrides for control systems.
    -> e.g. Ground faults - electrical controls
    -> Fire exits

** Exception handling

- handling a transaction outside of the normal process flow
  -> May be called error handling but and exception is not always an error
  -> Errors are mistakes - user input
  -> Exceptions are functionally abnormal operations
     - Alarm condition.

*** Error and exception handling requirements

-> Ensure error is handled correctly by the application
-> Logging
-> Fail in a secure manner - not open (so that data security is not compromised)
-> Ensure return to normal operating state
-> Deny by default

*** Non-verbose error handling

- *Do not provide data to the attacker!*
- Use error codes and *not line numbers*.


** Key points

- Exception handling ensures that assets will be protected even in the event of an error or failure.
