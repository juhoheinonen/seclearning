* Secure software concepts 7: Accounting
- Also known as auditing
- Tracking 
  -> Ensuring we have a record of all activities on the system, as well as being able to associate that activity with the entity that performed that activity.
- Logging
- Recording
  -> Operations and transactions, so we have a record of what changes were made and who made those changes. 
- Associationg all activity on a system with the user(s) (entities) involved in the activity.

** Accounting
- Provides proof of compliance.
  -> Logs are important for that
- Documents all changes and associated actor.
  -> A living record of what is the current state of a system.
- Provides evidence required for forensics.

** Protection of logs
- May contain sensitive information.
- Must be protected from alteration or deletion.
  -> Write off logs to a "write once, read many" device.
- Hash values.
  -> Prove the  integrity of the log.
  -> Even if a single bit was changed, the hash would be substantially different.


** Reviewing logs
- There should be a process in place that takes a look at what logs we have and reviews them.

- May indicate ongoing attacks, or attack precursors.
- Indicate attempts to access unauthorized content.
- *Review key logs - not all logs.*
 
** Log retention

- Keep logs as long as required for
  -> Business purposes
  -> Legal requirements 
- Ability to read archived log files.
  -> Ensure that logs are in format that you can access later even if technology changes.

** Key points

- Identity management is driven by the IAAA model (identification, authenticaion, authorization, accounting).
- All activity on a system should be tracked to enable accountability and to ensure regulatory compliance.
- Organizations must always seek a better, more efficient access control system that enforces access rules but does not unduly impact business operations.
- Establish accountability and compliance with regulations.
