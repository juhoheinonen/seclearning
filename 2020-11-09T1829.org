  - Cost-effective
  - Being managed and monitored
    Firewall is good but of limited use without people managing and monitoring it.
  - Ensuring that residual risk levels are acceptable
    - Try to evaluate correctly residual risk

** Control frameworks
- Cobit 5
- ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002
- SP800-53

** General controls
- Policies
- Procedures
  Maybe about updating and keeping systems up-todate 
- Physical controls
  Access to server room
- Administrative controls
- Accounting controls
- Operational controls

** System specific controls
 Controls implemented on an information system
  - Protect sensitive and critical functions
  - Safeguard access to systems and data

** Key points
- Controls are implemented to deal with risk
- Preventive
- Detective
- Corrective
- Administrative
- Technical
- Operational/physical
