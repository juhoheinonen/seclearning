* Secure software concepts 11: Economy of mechanigs and leveraging existing components.

- Based on the concept of not developing a function that can be provided by a already available mechanism/solutions
  -> Use the same access control system for multiple systems
     --> Federated identity management
     --> Single Sign-On

- Keeping the design of a system simple to reduce the attack surface and facilitate ease of use.


** Leveraging existing components

- Use existing investments in infrastructure
  -> Common libraries
  -> Common controls - firewalls etc.

- Advantages
  -> Capital expense. Use products already paid for.
  -> Architectural standardization. Compatibility and interoperability. Save on training and maintenance.
  -> Risk. Do not introduce new vulnerabilities through a new product.
  -> Save time. Reduce time for systems development.

- Risk
  -> Common flaws or vulnerabilities. A flaw will affect multiple systems.
  -> Vendor lock-in. Difficulty to move to an alternate vendor with a better product.
  -> Inflexibility. Hard to make a change on behalf of one system without affecting the other systems relying on the same libraries or components.
 
** Key points

- Economy of mechanism encourages the use of solutions that are available for more than one system.
- Leveraging existing components encourages the use of common libraries and controls that may be used by multiple applications or systems.
