* Secure software concepts 8: access control
- applications enable access to sensitive information
- applications handle users with different access level
- each user must be restricted to the correct level of access
- especially when one application calls another process

** Purpose

- *permit access* in an efficient and appropriate manner
  - allow access, not deny!
- Restrict unauthorized access whether to read or to modify

** Methods of implementing access control in information system
- PKI (public key infrastructure)
  - Allows us to establish authenticity of the users
- Federated management or other third party methods
- internal controls
- physical controls (user interface)

** Privileged access
- major security concern is users with privileged access levels
  - should be limited to personnel with a requirement for higher level permissions
  - may be a problem when *developers code with privileged access* and the system does not operate properly in production for *users with lower privileges*
  - may require compensating controls
  - additional monitoring?

** Runtime

- run time refers to when a process is executing (running) on a system
  - often uses privileged state (level of permission)
  - may require administrator approval to execute
  - systems shouild restrict apis from automatically running privileged programs
  - can be corrupted by malware

** Key points

- Access controls require careful setup and monitoring to ensure appropriate levels of access are given to all users, systems and processes
