* Secure softwre concepts 1: Secure design principles

** Security must be designed into information systems including:
- Applications
- Networks
- Hosts
- Databases

** Implementation of security concepts
- Security is enforced through the use of *controls*.
- Controls must be:
  - designed
  - developed
  - implemented
  - configured
  - operated
  - monitored
  - improved

*** Justification for Controls
- RISK
The likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and thereby causing damage to an asset.

*** Types of Controls
- managerial/administrative (policies etc.)
- technical/logical
- physical/environmental/operational

*** Controls are:
- a limitation
- a hindrance
- a cost

*** Examples of controls
- least privilege
- separation of duties
- defense in depth
- fail safe
- economy of mechanism
- complete mediation
- open design
- least common mechanism
- psychological acceptability
- leveraging existing components
- eliminate single points of failure

"Security concepts are implemented through controls."
"Controls are justified by risk."
"All three types of controls are needed: managerial, technical, and physical."
