* Secure software design 32: Models

** Security Models

Define the theory of access controls and systems security
- The concepts of the models are integrated into implementation

** Bell-LaPadula

State machine model - preserved state

Focus on confidentiality

Information flow model

Lattice based access protocol (level-based)

Sometimes is used Strong * - start security condition: you can only read and write to your own security level.

** BIBA integrity model

Addresses first goal of integrity:
- Unauthorized users cannot make modifications.

Establishes the subject-object relationship (called a tuple)

Introduced the invocation property - a user cannot execute a function of a higher privilege level

** Clark-Wilson model

User who wants to make a change must use program to do the change.

Access triple: subject-program-object.

** Other models

Take-grant

Lipner (implementation)

Sutherland

Boebert and Kain

"The security models describe the mathematical concepts of security that are built into the design of applications, operating systems and other IT components."
