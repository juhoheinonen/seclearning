* Secure software design 43: Encryption

Converting a message into a format that cannot be understood by unauthorized parties

Converts plaintext messages into ciphertext using an algorithm

** Benefits

Protects confidentiality of the message

Protects the integrity of the message

Proves authentication of the sender and receiver

Provides non-repudiation

Supports access control

** Uses of Encryption

Protects data in transit

Protects stored data

** Terminology

Plaintext or cleartext

Algorithm and the cryptosystem

Ciphertext or cryptogram

Symmetric algorithms. Same key in encryption and decryption. AES, DES, RC5.

Asymmetric algorithms. Key pair.

Key or cryptovariable.

** The secret to successsful use of Encryption

Protect the secret keys
- Use keys of a suitable length
- Do not lose the keys
- Change keys regularly

Use strong algorithms

Train staff in correct use of encryption

** Symmetric algorithms

Same key both to encrypt and decrypt the data
- Key cannot be sent together with the encrypted data - requires out of band transmission.

Excellent for confidentiality.

Rapid operations.
